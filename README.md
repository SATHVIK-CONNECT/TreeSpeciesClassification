# Tree Species Identification

# Overview
This project uses deep learning techniques to identify tree species from images. It's implemented in Google Colab using Python libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, PIL, and Matplotlib. The model is trained using the Conv2D technique and deployed as a Streamlit app.

## Using the Streamlit App
1. Open the Streamlit app in your web browser.
2. Upload an image of a tree species.
3. The app will predict the tree species and display the result.

# Model Details
## Conv2D Model Architecture
- Conv2D Model: The model uses the Conv2D technique to extract features from images.
- Training: The model is trained on a dataset of tree species images using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
- Evaluation: The model is evaluated on a test set and achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy].

# Future Work
## Potential Improvements
- Improve Model Accuracy: Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to improve model accuracy.
- Expand Dataset: Collect more data to expand the dataset and improve model generalizability.
